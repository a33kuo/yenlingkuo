  <h3>Thank you for visiting Yen-Ling's website!</h3>

  <p>I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT CSAIL</a> advised by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/boris/boris.html">Dr. Boris Katz</a>. I'm working on planning and plan understanding with compositional machine learning models to enhance robots' capabilities in interacting with humans and physical environments.</p>

  <p>Before coming to MIT, I was a software engineer at <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> Mountain View working on visual search for shopping and new shopping ads features. I received my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>, where I completed my master thesis on crowdsourcing and reasoning of commonsense knowledge in the <a href="http://agents.csie.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank">Intelligent Agents Lab</a>. I also spent a semester as a visiting student in the <a href="http://agents.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Software Agent Group</a> at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a> working on intelligent user interface. My <a href="pub/thesis-master.pdf" target="_blank">master thesis</a> is the best summary of my previous work.</p>

  <p>My research interests are to build machine that can act robustly, understand humans, be understood by humans. In more specific, my current work asks questions like:
  <ul>
    <li>How do humans plan so effectively in various environments? <br />How can robots plan as effectively?</li>
    <li>How do humans understand dangers in an environment to adjust their plans? <br />How can machines understand humans' believes of dangers?</li>
    <li>How do humans communicate their plans via actions? <br />
    How can machines recognize humans' plans and help them complete tasks?</li>
    <li>How do humans memorize and compose plans using languages? <br />
    How can machines transform the learned planning models to languages and make it programmable?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>I will be glad to discuss with you or hear any feedback you have. Please kindly send me an e-mail to <a>ylkuo@mit.edu</a> or leave a message <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uzfY5pjrTd0yv04wIKP0sAhlKSxn5jAPzd7YoOvqxlE/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you!
