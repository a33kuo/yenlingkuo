  <h3>Thank you for visiting Yen-Ling's website!</h3>

  <p>I am currently a software engineer working in the <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> Mountain View, California headquarters. I joined the Google Shopping team in 2012 and have been working on development of new shopping ads features. I also spent a summer to work as an intern in the Google Compare team in the Google Kirkland, Washington office, in 2011.</p>

  <p>Prior to joining Google, I was a master student in the <a href="http://agents.csie.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank">Intelligent Agents Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a> and a visiting student in the <a href="http://agents.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Software Agent Group</a> at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>. My research focuses on crowdsourcing, reasoning, and integration of commonsense knowledge for intelligent agents and user interfaces. My <a href="pub/thesis-master.pdf" target="_blank">master thesis</a> is the best summarization of the work.</p>

  <p>My interests span the fields of context-aware & multi-agent systems, commonsense reasoning, human computation, storytelling, and intelligent agents. In more specific, I am interested in:
  <ul>
    <li>How to build agent that understands context and uses it to facilitate human decision-making?</li>
    <li>How to coordinate machines and have them collaborate with human to solve real-world problems?</li>
    <li>How to transform machine-learned statistical models to symbolic programming and make an environment programmable?</li>
  </ul>
  You can also check my previous and ongoing projects in the <a class="go-project" href="?project">Projects</a> and <a class="go-publication" href="?publication">Publications</a> pages.</p>

  <p>I wish to leverage and apply my research experiences to more computer systems, or other research areas where you see my qualifications fit. I will be glad to answer any questions you may have. Please kindly send me an e-mail to <a>yenlingkuo.m@gmail.com</a> or leave a message <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uzfY5pjrTd0yv04wIKP0sAhlKSxn5jAPzd7YoOvqxlE/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>. I will reply to your email as fast as I can. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you again!
