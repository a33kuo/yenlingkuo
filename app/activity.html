    <h3>2015 GoogleServe at San Jose Heritage House</h3>
    <p>Every year Google has a GoogleServe week to encourage employees to work with local NGOs/NPOs to contribute back to local communities. I have participated every GoogleServe since I joined Google. In 2015, I joined the project on renovating the garden area of San Jose Heritage House to bring a better environment to Moms and babys in the Heritage House. In 2014, I helped build bike trail in Saratoga Sanborn County Park to bring a safe route to the Bay Area cyclists.</p>

    <h3>2011 Visiting Student in MIT</h3>
    <p>In addition to research on commonsense knowledge, I also participated several activities when I was a visiting student in MIT. Every Wednesday, I went to Prof. <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/" target="_blank">Marvin Minsky</a>'s (in the photo) class on The Emotion Machine and had great discussion about intelligence and cognitive AI in the class. I also presented applications powered by commonsense knowledge in Media Lab Sponsor Week. I was later invited to <a href="http://global.hisense.com/" target="_blank">Hisense</a>'s National Research Lab in Qingdao to give an in-depth tutorial on how to build voice interface with commonsense knowledge.</p>

    <h3>2008 Nightmarket Workshop at Tainan</h3>
    <p>Nightmarket workshop is the first event I participated that brings people with art, design, and technology background together. In the 5-day workshop, I worked with <a href="http://marisajahn.com/" target="_blank">Marisa Jahn</a> and <a href="http://www.pan-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Rothenberg</a>, and other teammate (in the photo) to create participatory art installation to bring up awareness of food safety and genetic modified food to general public.</p>
    <p>The idea of this installation: In many places, people did not pay much attention to the source of food and the problems of genetic modified food when they make purchase decision. In this work, we "invent" new fruits like zebra orange and monkey kiwi and sold in nightmarkets at Tainan to bring up people's attention to this issue.</p>

In the four-day conference, we shared personal stories, presented French culture in Global Village event with our hosted intern from France, and discussed how to start projects for social issues of that year. With this good start, we won The Best Local Committee of 2007-2008.</p>
